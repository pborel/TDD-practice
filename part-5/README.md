# Part 5: Schema Design

## Summary
In this challenge we'll design a database to persist the data provided by the models in the application.

### Background
The basis of this application is an online store. This has been simplified to try to focus solely on what data is required to fulfill the model's intended concept and show how these models would relate to each other.

### Submitting Your Solution
For this part of the assessment, we'll need to create and submit an image file of the designed database schema.  Designing the schema using [SQL Designer](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/sql) and submitting a screenshot of the final design is the suggested method for completing this challenge.  However, drawing your schema using another medium (e.g., pen and paper) is also acceptable, provided the visualization is legible and an image file depicting the final schema design can be added to the repo (e.g., a photo).

## Release 0: Model Attributes
Create the required tables with the corresponding columns that would support the data requirements of each model found in the `part-5/models` directory.

## Release 1: Relationships
Add the supporting foreign keys and/or join tables to allow the required one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.

## Release 2: Add Image
When you are satisfied with your schema, create an image file representing your design (e.g., a screenshot) and add it to the repository. The visualization of the final schema design should be saved as an image file named `schema.*`, (e.g., `schema.jpg` or `schema.png`).

## Conclusion
Once the image of your final schema design has been added, you have completed Part 5 of the assessment.  If you haven't done so already, commit your changes.

If you've completed Parts 1 - 5, you are done with the assessment.  Please wait until the end of the assessment period to push your branch to GitHub.
